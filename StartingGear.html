                In a hard, low-magic setting, your starting equipment and gold should reflect the scarcity of resources and the challenges they will face. Here's a custom starting equipment and gold system for this campaign:
            </p>
            <h2>Starting Gold:</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of using the standard starting gold by class, all characters begin with a modest sum of gold to purchase your initial equipment. each player starts with 25 gold pieces (gp) regardless of your chosen class.
            </p>
            <h2>Mundane Equipment:</h2>
            <p>
                you should purchase your starting equipment from the mundane (non-magical) items listed in the Player's Handbook, using your starting gold. Magical items, even those of minor power, are not available for purchase at character creation.
            </p>
            <h2>Modified Class Equipment:</h2>
            <p>
                Some classes come with specific starting equipment, such as spellcasting focuses or holy symbols. In a low-magic setting, you should work with me to adjust these items to fit the campaign's theme. For example, a wizard's arcane focus could be replaced with a collection of rare herbs and minerals used to cast spells, while a cleric's holy symbol might be a simple wooden icon that reflects your deity's connection to nature.
            </p>
            <h2>Basic Survival Gear:</h2>
            <p>
                I encourage you to invest in essential survival equipment such as rations, torches, rope, and other adventuring gear. These items will be crucial in a low-magic setting where magical solutions to everyday problems are scarce.
