                In the world of Dracorith, with the decline of magic and the focus on nature, wood elves have been adapted to these changes. Here are a few alterations for wood elves in this setting:
            </p>
            <h2>Enhanced Connection to Nature:</h2>
            <p>
                With the decline of magic, wood elves may have developed a stronger bond with the natural world. This could manifest as an increased proficiency in the Survival skill, or the ability to communicate with animals and plants on a basic level.
            </p>
            <h2>Woodland Crafting Expertise:</h2>
            <p>
                As skilled woodworkers and artisans, wood elves might have honed their craftsmanship abilities even further. They could have access to unique crafting techniques or the ability to create superior quality wooden items, such as weapons, armor, or tools.
            </p>
            <h2>Stronger Natural Camouflage:</h2>
            <p>
                To survive in a world where their innate magical abilities have diminished, wood elves may have developed better natural camouflage to blend in with their forest surroundings. This might give them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when in a wooded environment.
            </p>
            <h2>Adapted Spellcasting:</h2>
            <p>
                While their innate magical abilities may have been affected by the decline of magic, wood elves could have found ways to adapt their spellcasting to rely more on the natural energies of the world. This could mean that their spells focus more on nature, healing, or elemental powers, rather than traditional arcane magic.
