            <p>
                In a hard, low-magic setting, character creation and gameplay emphasizes the challenges and limitations that come with the scarcity of magic. Here are a few guidelines for you to follow when create a character in this campaign:
            </p>
            <h2>Starting Ability Scores:</h2>
            <p>
                you should roll your ability scores using the standard 4d6 method (roll four six-sided dice, drop the lowest die, and add the remaining three together). However, you should not re-roll any low scores. This will result in characters with more varied and potentially lower ability scores, reflecting the harsh nature of the setting.
            </p>
            <h2>Emphasize Non-Magical Classes:</h2>
            <p>
                I encourage you to choose non-magical classes such as Fighters, Rogues, Barbarians, or Monks. If you want to play spellcasting classes, you should have compelling backstories that explains how your characters gained magical abilities in a world where magic is nearly extinct. Additionally, spellcasters may face unique challenges and social stigmas due to your abilities.
            </p>
            <h2>Limited Magical Resources:</h2>
            <p>
                you should be aware that magical items, potions, and scrolls will be exceedingly rare and difficult to obtain. you should plan your characters accordingly, focusing on mundane equipment and investing in skills or tools related to survival, healing, and crafting.
            </p>
            <h2>Harsher Healing Rules:</h2>
            <p>
                Consider using alternative healing rules, such as "Slow Natural Healing" (characters don't automatically regain hit points after a long rest; you must use Hit Dice to heal) and limiting the effectiveness of magical healing to make the campaign more challenging.
            </p>
            <h2>Emphasize on Roleplaying and Resource Management:</h2>
            <p>
                In a low-magic setting, you should focus on your characters' non-magical abilities, skills, and roleplaying to overcome obstacles. Resource management becomes more important, as the scarcity of magical items and healing means that you must be more strategic in your decisions.
            </p>
            <h2>Stronger Non-Magical Threats:</h2>
            <p>
                In a world where magic is scarce, non-magical threats such as powerful beasts, cunning enemies, and deadly environments wiill pose significant challenges to the party. you should be prepared to face these dangers and may need to rely on your wits and creativity to survive.
