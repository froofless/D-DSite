            <h2>Stronger connection to nature:</h2>
            <p>With their mixed heritage, half-elves have developed a stronger bond with the natural world, similar to wood elves. This manifests as an increased proficiency in the Survival or Nature skill, or the ability to navigate through natural terrain more efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Blend of human and elven craftsmanship:</h2>
            <p>Half-elves have inherited the best qualities of human ingenuity and elven artistry, making them talented craftsmen.

            <h2>Versatile adaptability:</h2>
            <p>In a world where resources are scarce and magic is rare, half-elves have honed their adaptability even further. They have access to additional skill or tool proficiencies, reflecting their ability to learn and adapt to a wide range of situations.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Racial harmony:</h2>
            <p>Half-elves are seen as mediators between humans and elves in a world where both races need to cooperate to survive. This unique heritage grants them advantage on Charisma-based checks when dealing with members of either race, as they can bridge the gap and facilitate understanding between the two cultures.</p>
